              For too long, the incredible achievements and challenges of African founders have been
              whispered among family or hidden behind a polite reserve. We believe this silence is a
              disservice to the world.
            </p>
            <p class="text-hero mb-8">
              We created Origin Stories to give these narratives a voice.

                We challenge the notion that talking about success, excellence, or overcoming
                challenges is "in bad taste." We celebrate it.

                Unlike other ecosystems, African founders rarely get credit for their perseverance
                through failure. We showcase the relentless challenges and creative solutions not as
                setbacks, but as the badges of honour that prove character and resilience.
              </span>
            </li>
            <li class="flex items-start gap-4 text-hero text-white">
              <span>
                In a relational business culture, trust is everything. We give founders a recorded
                asset that tells their personal history, character, and mission. This allows
                partners and investors to move faster and deeper than any transactional pitch could
                allow.

              <span>
                The standard Silicon Valley pitch format is useful, but it lacks Heart & Soul. We
                bring back the personal Origin Story; what inspired you, what you gave up, and why
                this problem consumed you.
