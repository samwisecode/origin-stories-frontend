            Inspired by Cape Town, our love for adventure, and our mission to protect the outdoors -
            Sealand is a lifestyle brand that focuses on responsibly made gear and apparel. Our
            mission is to ensure that every decision we make keeps the planet and its people front
            and centre. With this in mind, all of our bags and apparel are made from waste or
            responsibly and ethically sourced materials.

          <p class="text-lg md:text-xl mb-4">
            The structural waste or meticulously sourced material is then combined with high-quality
            hardware, innovative design, and expert craftsmanship to create gear that will last a
            lifetime. Our upcycled and responsibly sourced materials are sturdy and weather
            resistant, making them perfect for any adventure.
